abstract = {The polyadenylation signal plays a key role in determining the site for addition of a polyadenylated tail to nascent mRNA and its mutation(s) are reported in many diseases. Thus, identifying poly(A) sites is important for understanding the regulation and stability of mRNA. In this study, Support Vector Machine (SVM) models have been developed for predicting poly(A) signals in a DNA sequence using 100 nucleotides, each upstream and downstream of this signal. Here, we introduced a novel split nucleotide frequency technique, and the models thus developed achieved maximum Matthews correlation coefficients (MCC) of 0.58, 0.69, 0.70 and 0.69 using mononucleotide, dinucleotide, trinucleotide, and tetranucleotide frequencies, respectively. Finally, a hybrid model developed using a combination of dinucleotide, 2nd order dinucleotide and tetranucleotide frequencies, achieved a maximum MCC of 0.72. Moreover, for independent datasets this model achieved a precision ranging from 75.8-95.7\% with a sensitivity of 57\%, which is better than any other known methods.},

abstract = {Large numbers of long RNAs with little or no protein-coding potential [long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)] are being identified in eukaryotes. In parallel, increasing data describing the expression profiles, molecular features and functions of individual lncRNAs in a variety of systems are accumulating. To enable the systematic compilation and updating of this information, we have developed a database (lncRNAdb) containing a comprehensive list of lncRNAs that have been shown to have, or to be associated with, biological functions in eukaryotes, as well as messenger RNAs that have regulatory roles. Each entry contains referenced information about the RNA, including sequences, structural information, genomic context, expression, subcellular localization, conservation, functional evidence and other relevant information. lncRNAdb can be searched by querying published RNA names and aliases, sequences, species and associated protein-coding genes, as well as terms contained in the annotations, such as the tissues in which the transcripts are expressed and associated diseases. In addition, lncRNAdb is linked to the UCSC Genome Browser for visualization and Noncoding RNA Expression Database (NRED) for expression information from a variety of sources. lncRNAdb provides a platform for the ongoing collation of the literature pertaining to lncRNAs and their association with other genomic elements. lncRNAdb can be accessed at: http://www.lncrnadb.org/.},

abstract = {The MEME Suite web server provides a unified portal for online discovery and analysis of sequence motifs representing features such as DNA binding sites and protein interaction domains. The popular MEME motif discovery algorithm is now complemented by the GLAM2 algorithm which allows discovery of motifs containing gaps. Three sequence scanning algorithms--MAST, FIMO and GLAM2SCAN--allow scanning numerous DNA and protein sequence databases for motifs discovered by MEME and GLAM2. Transcription factor motifs (including those discovered using MEME) can be compared with motifs in many popular motif databases using the motif database scanning algorithm TOMTOM. Transcription factor motifs can be further analyzed for putative function by association with Gene Ontology (GO) terms using the motif-GO term association tool GOMO. MEME output now contains sequence LOGOS for each discovered motif, as well as buttons to allow motifs to be conveniently submitted to the sequence and motif database scanning algorithms (MAST, FIMO and TOMTOM), or to GOMO, for further analysis. GLAM2 output similarly contains buttons for further analysis using GLAM2SCAN and for rerunning GLAM2 with different parameters. All of the motif-based tools are now implemented as web services via Opal. Source code, binaries and a web server are freely available for noncommercial use at http://meme.nbcr.net.},

abstract = {Gene expression microarrays are the most widely used technique for genome-wide expression profiling. However, microarrays do not perform well on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue (FFPET). Consequently, microarrays cannot be effectively utilized to perform gene expression profiling on the vast majority of archival tumor samples. To address this limitation of gene expression microarrays, we designed a novel procedure (3'-end sequencing for expression quantification (3SEQ)) for gene expression profiling from FFPET using next-generation sequencing. We performed gene expression profiling by 3SEQ and microarray on both frozen tissue and FFPET from two soft tissue tumors (desmoid type fibromatosis (DTF) and solitary fibrous tumor (SFT)) (total n = 23 samples, which were each profiled by at least one of the four platform-tissue preparation combinations). Analysis of 3SEQ data revealed many genes differentially expressed between the tumor types (FDR<0.01) on both the frozen tissue (approximately 9.6K genes) and FFPET (approximately 8.1K genes). Analysis of microarray data from frozen tissue revealed fewer differentially expressed genes (approximately 4.64K), and analysis of microarray data on FFPET revealed very few (69) differentially expressed genes. Functional gene set analysis of 3SEQ data from both frozen tissue and FFPET identified biological pathways known to be important in DTF and SFT pathogenesis and suggested several additional candidate oncogenic pathways in these tumors. These findings demonstrate that 3SEQ is an effective technique for gene expression profiling from archival tumor samples and may facilitate significant advances in translational cancer research.},

Current methods for poly(A) site prediction achieve moderate sensitivity and specificity. Here, we present a method using support vector machine for poly(A) site prediction. Using 15 cis-regulatory elements that are over-represented in various regions surrounding poly(A) sites, this method achieves higher sensitivity and similar specificity when compared with polyadq, a common tool for poly(A) site prediction. In addition, we found that while the polyadenylation signal AAUAAA and U-rich elements are primary determinants for poly(A) site prediction, other elements contribute to both sensitivity and specificity of the prediction, indicating a combinatorial mechanism involving multiple elements when choosing poly(A) sites in human cells.},

This is embodied in DARN!, a software tool for ncRNA localization, which, compared to existing pattern-matching based tools, offers additional expressivity (such as enabling RNARNA interactions to be described) and improved specificity (through the exploitation of scores and local optimality) without compromises in CPU efficiency. This is demonstrated on the actual search for tRNAs and H/ACA sRNA on different genomes.},

Even in the animal species, the AAUAAA signal does not appear to be as universal as indicated by previous studies. The abundance of single-base variants of AAUAAA correlates with their measured processing efficiencies. As found previously, the plant polyadenylation signals are more similar to those of yeast than to those of animals, with both common content and arrangement of the signal elements. In all species examined, the complete polyadenylation signal appears to consist of an aggregate of multiple elements. In light of these and previous results, we present a broadened concept of 3'-end-processing signals in which no single exact sequence element is universally required for processing. Rather, the total efficiency is a function of all elements and, importantly, an inefficient word in one element can be compensated for by strong words in other elements. These complex patterns indicate that effective tools to identify 3'-end-processing signals will require more than consensus sequence identification.},

(2) Technical limitations of the previous version, such as the inability to handle alignments with more than six sequences, are overcome by increased training data and the usage of an entropy measure to represent sequence similarities. RNAz 2.0 shows a significantly lower false discovery rate on a dinucleotide background model than the previous version.

Thorough annotation of gene 3' ends revealed over 5,000 previously overlooked pAs (∼8\% of total) flanked by A-rich sequences, underscoring the necessity of using an accurate tool for pA mapping. About 79\% of mRNA genes and 66\% of long noncoding RNA genes undergo APA, but these two gene types have distinct usage patterns for pAs in introns and upstream exons. Quantitative analysis of APA isoforms by 3'READS indicated that promoter-distal pAs, regardless of intron or exon locations, become more abundant during embryonic development and cell differentiation and that upregulated isoforms have stronger pAs, suggesting global modulation of the 3' end-processing activity in development and differentiation.},

abstract = {Post-transcriptional gene regulation frequently occurs through elements in mRNA 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). Although crucial roles for 3'UTR-mediated gene regulation have been found in Caenorhabditis elegans, most C. elegans genes have lacked annotated 3'UTRs. Here we describe a high-throughput method for reliable identification of polyadenylated RNA termini, and we apply this method, called poly(A)-position profiling by sequencing (3P-Seq), to determine C. elegans 3'UTRs. Compared to standard methods also recently applied to C. elegans UTRs, 3P-Seq identified 8,580 additional UTRs while excluding thousands of shorter UTR isoforms that do not seem to be authentic. Analysis of this expanded and corrected data set suggested that the high A/U content of C. elegans 3'UTRs facilitated genome compaction, because the elements specifying cleavage and polyadenylation, which are A/U rich, can more readily emerge in A/U-rich regions. Indeed, 30\% of the protein-coding genes have mRNAs with alternative, partially overlapping end regions that generate another 10,480 cleavage and polyadenylation sites that had gone largely unnoticed and represent potential evolutionary intermediates of progressive UTR shortening. Moreover, a third of the convergently transcribed genes use palindromic arrangements of bidirectional elements to specify UTRs with convergent overlap, which also contributes to genome compaction by eliminating regions between genes. Although nematode 3'UTRs have median length only one-sixth that of mammalian 3'UTRs, they have twice the density of conserved microRNA sites, in part because additional types of seed-complementary sites are preferentially conserved. These findings reveal the influence of cleavage and polyadenylation on the evolution of genome architecture and provide resources for studying post-transcriptional gene regulation.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The majority of mammalian genes contain multiple poly(A) sites in their 3' UTRs. Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation are emerging as an important layer of gene regulation as they generate transcript isoforms that differ in their 3' UTRs, thereby modulating genes' response to 3' UTR-mediated regulation. Enhanced cleavage at 3' UTR proximal poly(A) sites resulting in global 3' UTR shortening was recently linked to proliferation and cancer. However, mechanisms that regulate this enhanced alternative polyadenylation are unknown. RESULTS: Here, we explored, on a transcriptome-wide scale, alternative polyadenylation events associated with cellular proliferation and neoplastic transformation. We applied a deep-sequencing technique for identification and quantification of poly(A) sites to two human cellular models, each examined under proliferative, arrested and transformed states. In both cell systems we observed global 3' UTR shortening associated with proliferation, a link that was markedly stronger than the association with transformation. Furthermore, we found that proliferation is also associated with enhanced cleavage at intronic poly(A) sites. Last, we found that the expression level of the set of genes that encode for 3'-end processing proteins is globally elevated in proliferation, and that E2F transcription factors contribute to this regulation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results comprehensively identify alternative polyadenylation events associated with cellular proliferation and transformation, and demonstrate that the enhanced alternative polyadenylation in proliferative conditions results not only in global 3' UTR shortening but also in enhanced premature cleavage in introns. Our results also indicate that E2F-mediated co-transcriptional regulation of 3'-end processing genes is one of the mechanisms that links enhanced alternative polyadenylation to proliferation.},

abstract = {Small non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have systematically been studied in various model organisms from Escherichia coli to Homo sapiens. Here, we analyse the small ncRNA transcriptome from the pathogenic filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. To that aim, we experimentally screened for ncRNAs, expressed under various growth conditions or during specific developmental stages, by generating a specialized cDNA library from size-selected small RNA species. Our screen revealed 30 novel ncRNA candidates from known ncRNA classes such as small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and C/D box-type small nucleolar RNAs (C/D box snoRNAs). Additionally, several candidates for H/ACA box snoRNAs could be predicted by a bioinformatical screen. We also identified 15 candidates for ncRNAs, which could not be assigned to any known ncRNA class. Some of these ncRNA species are developmentally regulated implying a possible novel function in A. fumigatus development. Surprisingly, in addition to full-length tRNAs, we also identified 5'- or 3'-halves of tRNAs, only, which are likely generated by tRNA cleavage within the anti-codon loop. We show that conidiation induces tRNA cleavage resulting in tRNA depletion within conidia. Since conidia represent the resting state of A. fumigatus we propose that conidial tRNA depletion might be a novel mechanism to down-regulate protein synthesis in a filamentous fungus.},

However, the task of identifying poly(A) motifs in the primary genomic DNA sequence that correspond to poly(A) signals in mRNA is a far more challenging problem. Recognition of poly(A) signals is important for better gene annotation and understanding of the gene regulation mechanisms. In this work, we present one such poly(A) motif prediction method based on properties of human genomic DNA sequence surrounding a poly(A) motif. These properties include thermodynamic, physico-chemical and statistical characteristics. For predictions, we developed Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest models. These models are trained to recognize 12 most common poly(A) motifs in human DNA. Our predictors are available as a free web-based tool accessible at http://cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/dps. Compared with other reported predictors, our models achieve higher sensitivity and specificity and furthermore provide a consistent level of accuracy for 12 poly(A) motif variants.

abstract = {Non-coding RNA (ncRNA) play an important and varied role in cellular function. A significant amount of research has been devoted to computational prediction of these genes from genomic sequence, but the ability to do so has remained elusive due to a lack of apparent genomic features. In this work, thermodynamic stability of ncRNA structural elements, as summarized in a Z-score, is used to predict ncRNA in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This analysis was coupled with comparative genomics to search for ncRNA genes on chromosome six of S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus. Sets of positive and negative control genes were evaluated to determine the efficacy of thermodynamic stability for discriminating ncRNA from background sequence. The effect of window sizes and step sizes on the sensitivity of ncRNA identification was also explored. Non-coding RNA gene candidates, common to both S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus, were verified using northern blot analysis, rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), and publicly available cDNA library data. Four ncRNA transcripts are well supported by experimental data (RUF10, RUF11, RUF12, RUF13), while one additional putative ncRNA transcript is well supported but the data are not entirely conclusive. Six candidates appear to be structural elements in 5' or 3' untranslated regions of annotated protein-coding genes. This work shows that thermodynamic stability, coupled with comparative genomics, can be used to predict ncRNA with significant structural elements.},

These analyses include RNA secondary structure motif discovery, EST support evaluation, cis-regulatory element search, protein homology search, etc. fRNAdb provides an efficient interface to help users filter out particular transcripts under their own criteria to sort out functional RNA candidates. fRNAdb is available at http://www.ncrna.org/},

abstract = {Investigation of noncoding RNAs is in rapid progress, especially regarding translational repression by small (short) noncoding RNAs like microRNAs with 20-25 nucleotide-lengths, while long noncoding RNAs with nucleotide length of more than two hundred are also emerging. Indeed, our analysis has revealed that a long noncoding RNA transcribed from cyclin D1 promoter of 200 and 300 nucleotides exerts transcriptional repression through its binding protein TLS instead of translational repression. Translational repression is executed by short noncoding RNAs, while transcriptional repression is mainly done by long noncoding RNAs. These long noncoding RNAs are heterogeneous molecules and employ divergent molecular mechanisms to exert transcriptional repression. In this review, I overview recent publications regarding the transcription regulation by long noncoding RNAs and explore their biological significance. In addition, the relation between a random transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase II and the origin of long noncoding RNAs is discussed.},

abstract = {The publication of a complete genome sequence is usually accompanied by annotations of its genes. In contrast to protein coding genes, genes for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) are often poorly or inconsistently annotated. This makes comparative studies based on rRNA genes difficult. We have therefore created computational predictors for the major rRNA species from all kingdoms of life and compiled them into a program called RNAmmer. The program uses hidden Markov models trained on data from the 5S ribosomal RNA database and the European ribosomal RNA database project. A pre-screening step makes the method fast with little loss of sensitivity, enabling the analysis of a complete bacterial genome in less than a minute. Results from running RNAmmer on a large set of genomes indicate that the location of rRNAs can be predicted with a very high level of accuracy. Novel, unannotated rRNAs are also predicted in many genomes. The software as well as the genome analysis results are available at the CBS web server.},

abstract = {ERPIN is an RNA motif identification program that takes an RNA sequence alignment as an input and identifies related sequences using a profile-based dynamic programming algorithm. ERPIN differs from other RNA motif search programs in its ability to capture subtle biases in the training set and produce highly specific and sensitive searches, while keeping CPU requirements at a practical level. In its latest version, ERPIN also computes E-values, which tell biologists how likely they are to encounter a specific sequence match by chance-a useful indication of biological significance. We present here the ERPIN online search interface (http://tagc.univ-mrs.fr/erpin/). This web server automatically performs ERPIN searches for different RNA genes or motifs, using predefined training sets and search parameters. With a couple of clicks, users can analyze an entire bacterial genome or a genomic segment of up to 5Mb for the presence of tRNAs, 5S rRNAs, SRP RNA, C/D box snoRNAs, hammerhead motifs, miRNAs and other motifs. Search results are displayed with sequence, score, position, E-value and secondary structure graphics. An example of a complete genome scan is provided, as well as an evaluation of run times and specificity/sensitivity information for all available motifs.},

abstract = {The snoRNA-LBME-db is a dedicated database containing human C/D box and H/ACA box small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), and small Cajal body-specific RNAs (scaRNAs). C/D box and H/ACA box snoRNAs are part of ribonucleoparticles that guide 2'-O-ribose methylation and pseudouridilation, respectively, of selected residues of 28S, 18S or 5.8S rRNAs or of the spliceosomal U6 RNA. Similarly, scaRNAs guide modifications of the spliceosomal RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase II (U1, U2, U4, U5 and U12) and are often composed of both C/D box and H/ACA box domains. However, some snoRNAs do not function as modification guide RNAs, but rather as RNA chaperones during the maturation of pre-rRNA. The database was built by a compilation of the literature, and comprises human sno/scaRNAs that were experimentally verified, as well as the human orthologs of snoRNAs that were cloned in other vertebrate species, and some snoRNAs that are predicted by bioinformatics search in loci submitted to genomic imprinting, but have not all been experimentally verified. For each entry, the database identifies the modified nucleotide(s) in the target RNA(s), indicates the corresponding predicted base pairing, gives a few pertinent references and provides a link to the position of the sno/scaRNA on the UCSC Genome Browser. The 'Find guide RNA' function allows one to find the sno/scaRNAs predicted to guide the modification of a particular nucleotide in the rRNA and spliceosomal RNA sequences. The 'Browse' function allows one to download the sequences of selected sno/scaRNAs in the FASTA format. The database is available online at http://www-snorna.biotoul.fr/. It can also be accessed from the human UCSC Genome Browser via the sno/miRNA track.},

abstract = {Using a novel program, SignalSleuth, and a database containing authenticated polyadenylation [poly(A)] sites, we analyzed the composition of mRNA poly(A) signals in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and reevaluated previously described cis-elements within the 3'-untranslated (UTR) regions, including near upstream elements and far upstream elements. As predicted, there are absences of high-consensus signal patterns. The AAUAAA signal topped the near upstream elements patterns and was found within the predicted location to only approximately 10\% of 3'-UTRs. More importantly, we identified a new set, named cleavage elements, of poly(A) signals flanking both sides of the cleavage site. These cis-elements were not previously revealed by conventional mutagenesis and are contemplated as a cluster of signals for cleavage site recognition. Moreover, a single-nucleotide profile scan on the 3'-UTR regions unveiled a distinct arrangement of alternate stretches of U and A nucleotides, which led to a prediction of the formation of secondary structures. Using an RNA secondary structure prediction program, mFold, we identified three main types of secondary structures on the sequences analyzed. Surprisingly, these observed secondary structures were all interrupted in previously constructed mutations in these regions. These results will enable us to revise the current model of plant poly(A) signals and to develop tools to predict 3'-ends for gene annotation.},

Many of these RNA structures are assembled from a collection of RNA structural motifs. These basic building blocks are used repeatedly, and in various combinations, to form different RNA types and define their unique structural and functional properties. Identification of recurring RNA structural motifs will therefore enhance our understanding of RNA structure and help associate elements of RNA structure with functional and regulatory elements. Our goal was to develop a computer program that can describe an RNA structural element of any complexity and then search any nucleotide sequence database, including the complete prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, for these structural elements. Here we describe in detail a new computational motif search algorithm, RNAMotif, and demonstrate its utility with some motif search examples. RNAMotif differs from other motif search tools in two important aspects: first, the structure definition language is more flexible and can specify any type of base-base interaction; second, RNAMotif provides a user controlled scoring section that can be used to add capabilities that patterns alone cannot provide.},

It has been suggested that microRNAs, or miRNAs, control developmental processes such as meristem cell identity, organ polarity, and developmental timing by interfering with the expression of mRNAs. Our preliminary analysis focuses on the miR166 family since it has been shown to mediate repression of rolled-leaf1 (rdl1) in maize. Based on maize sequences derived from degenerate primers, we computationally identified miR166b, miR166c, miR166d, and four more closely related putative maize precursors. Patscan, a pattern-matching program that allows RNA basepairing and mismatches, was used to identify functional elements in the putative hairpins. Each hairpin was further supported by their stable secondary structures determined with Mfold. Using this pattern matching approach we expanded the analysis for 19 Arabidopsis miRNA families in rice and maize.},

abstract = {Messenger RNA (mRNA) 3' end formation is a nuclear process through which all eukaryotic primary transcripts are endonucleolytically cleaved and most of them acquire a poly(A) tail. This process, which consists in the recognition of defined poly(A) signals of the pre-mRNAs by a large cleavage/polyadenylation machinery, plays a critical role in gene expression. Indeed, the poly(A) tail of a mature mRNA is essential for its functions, including stability, translocation to the cytoplasm and translation. In addition, this process serves as a bridge in the network connecting the different transcription, capping, splicing and export machineries. It also participates in the quantitative and qualitative regulation of gene expression in a variety of biological processes through the selection of single or alternative poly(A) signals in transcription units. A large number of protein factors associates with this machinery to regulate the efficiency and specificity of this process and to mediate its interaction with other nuclear events. Here, we review the eukaryotic 3' end processing machineries as well as the comprehensive set of regulatory factors and discuss the different molecular mechanisms of 3' end processing regulation by proposing several overlapping models of regulation.},

Such truncated cDNAs may contribute to 12\% of the expressed sequence tags in the current dbEST database. By using a synthetic transcript and real mRNA templates as models, we characterized the patterns of internal poly(A) priming by oligo(dT) primer. We further demonstrated that the internal poly(A) priming can be effectively diminished by replacing the oligo(dT) primer with a set of anchored oligo(dT) primers for reverse transcription. Our study indicates that cDNAs designed for genomewide gene identification should be synthesized by use of the anchored oligo(dT) primers, rather than the oligo(dT) primers, to diminish the generation of truncated cDNAs caused by internal poly(A) priming.},

Infernal uses CMs to search for new family members in sequence databases, and to create potentially large multiple sequence alignments. Version 1.1 of Infernal introduces a new filter pipeline for RNA homology search based on accelerated profile HMM methods and HMM-banded CM alignment methods. This enables a roughly 100-fold acceleration over the previous version and roughly a 10,000-fold acceleration over exhaustive, non-filtered CM searches.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: Source code, documentation, and the benchmark are downloadable from http://infernal.janelia.org.

abstract = {Polyadenylation [poly(A)] signals (PAS) are a defining feature of eukaryotic protein-coding genes. The central sequence motif AAUAAA was identified in the mid-1970s and subsequently shown to require flanking, auxiliary elements for both 3'-end cleavage and polyadenylation of premessenger RNA (pre-mRNA) as well as to promote downstream transcriptional termination. More recent genomic analysis has established the generality of the PAS for eukaryotic mRNA. Evidence for the mechanism of mRNA 3'-end formation is outlined, as is the way this RNA processing reaction communicates with RNA polymerase II to terminate transcription. The widespread phenomenon of alternative poly(A) site usage and how this interrelates with pre-mRNA splicing is then reviewed. This shows that gene expression can be drastically affected by how the message is ended. A central theme of this review is that while genomic analysis provides generality for the importance of PAS selection, detailed mechanistic understanding still requires the direct analysis of specific genes by genetic and biochemical approaches.},

abstract = {We developed PolyA-seq, a strand-specific and quantitative method for high-throughput sequencing of 3' ends of polyadenylated transcripts, and used it to globally map polyadenylation (polyA) sites in 24 matched tissues in human, rhesus, dog, mouse, and rat. We show that PolyA-seq is as accurate as existing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approaches for digital gene expression (DGE), enabling simultaneous mapping of polyA sites and quantitative measurement of their usage. In human, we confirmed 158,533 known sites and discovered 280,857 novel sites (FDR < 2.5\%). On average 10\% of novel human sites were also detected in matched tissues in other species. Most novel sites represent uncharacterized alternative polyA events and extensions of known transcripts in human and mouse, but primarily delineate novel transcripts in the other three species. A total of 69.1\% of known human genes that we detected have multiple polyA sites in their 3'UTRs, with 49.3\% having three or more. We also detected polyadenylation of noncoding and antisense transcripts, including constitutive and tissue-specific primary microRNAs. The canonical polyA signal was strongly enriched and positionally conserved in all species. In general, usage of polyA sites is more similar within the same tissues across different species than within a species. These quantitative maps of polyA usage in evolutionarily and functionally related samples constitute a resource for understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying alternative polyadenylation.},

abstract = {Messenger RNA (mRNA) stability, localization, and translation are largely determined by sequences in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). We found a conserved increase in expression of mRNAs terminating at upstream polyadenylation sites after activation of primary murine CD4+ T lymphocytes. This program, resulting in shorter 3'UTRs, is a characteristic of gene expression during immune cell activation and correlates with proliferation across diverse cell types and tissues. Forced expression of full-length 3'UTRs conferred reduced protein expression. In some cases the reduction in protein expression could be reversed by deletion of predicted microRNA target sites in the variably included region. Our data indicate that gene expression is coordinately regulated, such that states of increased proliferation are associated with widespread reductions in the 3'UTR-based regulatory capacity of mRNAs.},

abstract = {Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are two of the largest classes of non-protein-coding RNAs. Conventional gene finders that detect protein-coding genes do not find tRNA and snoRNA genes because they lack the codon structure and statistical signatures of protein-coding genes. Previously, we developed tRNAscan-SE, snoscan and snoGPS for the detection of tRNAs, methylation-guide snoRNAs and pseudouridylation-guide snoRNAs, respectively. tRNAscan-SE is routinely applied to completed genomes, resulting in the identification of thousands of tRNA genes. Snoscan has successfully detected methylation-guide snoRNAs in a variety of eukaryotes and archaea, and snoGPS has identified novel pseudouridylation-guide snoRNAs in yeast and mammals. Although these programs have been quite successful at RNA gene detection, their use has been limited by the need to install and configure the software packages on UNIX workstations. Here, we describe online implementations of these RNA detection tools that make these programs accessible to a wider range of research biologists. The tRNAscan-SE, snoscan and snoGPS servers are available at http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/tRNAscan-SE/, http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/snoscan/ and http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/snoGPS/, respectively.},

Studies on various organisms have led to the realization that these noncanonical PAPs, which are conserved from yeast to mammals, play crucial and diverse roles in the regulation of gene expression.

abstract = {Alternative polyadenylation (APA) of mRNAs has emerged as an important mechanism for post-transcriptional gene regulation in higher eukaryotes. Although microarrays have recently been used to characterize APA globally, they have a number of serious limitations that prevents comprehensive and highly quantitative analysis. To better characterize APA and its regulation, we have developed a deep sequencing-based method called Poly(A) Site Sequencing (PAS-Seq) for quantitatively profiling RNA polyadenylation at the transcriptome level. PAS-Seq not only accurately and comprehensively identifies poly(A) junctions in mRNAs and noncoding RNAs, but also provides quantitative information on the relative abundance of polyadenylated RNAs. PAS-Seq analyses of human and mouse transcriptomes showed that 40\%-50\% of all expressed genes produce alternatively polyadenylated mRNAs. Furthermore, our study detected evolutionarily conserved polyadenylation of histone mRNAs and revealed novel features of mitochondrial RNA polyadenylation. Finally, PAS-Seq analyses of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, neural stem/progenitor (NSP) cells, and neurons not only identified more poly(A) sites than what was found in the entire mouse EST database, but also detected significant changes in the global APA profile that lead to lengthening of 3' untranslated regions (UTR) in many mRNAs during stem cell differentiation. Together, our PAS-Seq analyses revealed a complex landscape of RNA polyadenylation in mammalian cells and the dynamic regulation of APA during stem cell differentiation.},

New features include an expanded repertoire of tools to assess RNA-RNA interactions and restricted ensembles of structures, additional output information such as centroid structures and maximum expected accuracy structures derived from base pairing probabilities, or z-scores for locally stable secondary structures, and support for input in fasta format.

This data set comprised 1065 sequences derived from 1042 unique genes. The average 3' UTR length in A. oryzae was 241 nt, which is greater than that in yeast but similar to that in plants. The 3' UTR and 100 nt sequence downstream of the poly(A) site is notably U-rich, while the region located 15-30 nt upstream of the poly(A) site is markedly A-rich. The most frequently found hexanucleotide in this A-rich region is AAUGAA, although this sequence accounts for only 6\% of all transcripts. These data suggested that A. oryzae has no highly conserved sequence element equivalent to AAUAAA, a mammalian polyadenylation signal. We identified that putative 3'-end-processing signals in A. oryzae, while less well conserved than those in mammals, comprised four sequence elements: the furthest upstream U-rich element, A-rich sequence, cleavage site, and downstream U-rich element flanking the cleavage site. Although these putative 3'-end-processing signals are similar to those in yeast and plants, some notable differences exist between them.},

We found that a great proportion of human and mouse genes have alternative polyadenylation ( approximately 54 and 32\%, respectively). The conservation of alternative polyadenylation type or polyadenylation configuration between human and mouse orthologs is statistically significant, indicating that alternative polyadenylation is widely employed by these two species to produce alternative gene transcripts. Genes belonging to several functional groups, indicated by their Gene Ontology annotations, are biased with respect to polyadenylation configuration. Many poly(A) sites harbor multiple cleavage sites (51.25\% human and 46.97\% mouse sites), leading to heterogeneous 3' end formation for transcripts. This implies that the cleavage process of polyadenylation is largely imprecise. Different types of poly(A) sites, with regard to their relative locations in a gene, are found to have distinct nucleotide composition in surrounding genomic regions. This large-scale study provides important insights into the mechanism of polyadenylation in mammalian species and represents a genomic view of the regulation of gene expression by alternative polyadenylation.},

abstract = {This paper presents a study on polyadenylation site prediction in mRNA sequences. We describe a method, called PolyA-EP, that we developed for predicting polyadenylation sites and we present a systematic study of the problem of recognizing mRNA 3' ends which contain a polyadenylation site using the proposed method. PolyA-EP exploits the advantages of emerging patterns, namely high understandability and discriminating power and can be used for both descriptive and predictive analysis. In particular, PolyA-EP is a parameterizable tool that can be used in order to extract interesting emerging patterns for describing or predicting polyadenylation sites. Moreover, the extracted emerging patterns can span across many elements around the polyadenylation site. We discuss the results of the experiments we conducted with Arabidopsis thaliana sequences drawing important conclusions and finally we propose a framework that improves the accuracy of polyadenylation site prediction.},

@article{Wang2008,
abstract = {Through alternative processing of pre-messenger RNAs, individual mammalian genes often produce multiple mRNA and protein isoforms that may have related, distinct or even opposing functions. Here we report an in-depth analysis of 15 diverse human tissue and cell line transcriptomes on the basis of deep sequencing of complementary DNA fragments, yielding a digital inventory of gene and mRNA isoform expression. Analyses in which sequence reads are mapped to exon-exon junctions indicated that 92-94\% of human genes undergo alternative splicing, 86\% with a minor isoform frequency of 15\% or more. Differences in isoform-specific read densities indicated that most alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation events vary between tissues, whereas variation between individuals was approximately twofold to threefold less common. Extreme or 'switch-like' regulation of splicing between tissues was associated with increased sequence conservation in regulatory regions and with generation of full-length open reading frames. Patterns of alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation were strongly correlated across tissues, suggesting coordinated regulation of these processes, and sequence conservation of a subset of known regulatory motifs in both alternative introns and 3' untranslated regions suggested common involvement of specific factors in tissue-level regulation of both splicing and polyadenylation.},

abstract = {The use of alternative poly(A) sites is common and affects the post-transcriptional fate of mRNA, including its stability, subcellular localization and translation. Here, we present a method to identify poly(A) sites in a genome-wide and strand-specific manner. This method, termed 3'T-fill, initially fills in the poly(A) stretch with unlabeled dTTPs, allowing sequencing to start directly after the poly(A) tail into the 3'-untranslated regions (UTR). Our comparative analysis demonstrates that it outperforms existing protocols in quality and throughput and accurately quantifies RNA levels as only one read is produced from each transcript. We use this method to characterize the diversity of polyadenylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, showing that alternative RNA molecules are present even in a genetically identical cell population. Finally, we observe that overlap of convergent 3'-UTRs is frequent but sharply limited by coding regions, suggesting factors that restrict compression of the yeast genome.},

abstract = {Surveys of transcription in many organisms have observed widespread expression of RNAs with no known function, encoded within and between canonical coding genes. The search to distinguish functional RNAs from transcriptional noise represents one of the great challenges in genomic biology. Here we report a next-generation sequencing technique designed to facilitate the inference of function of uncharacterized transcript forms by improving their coverage in sequencing libraries, in parallel with the detection of canonical mRNAs. We piloted this protocol, which is based on the capture of 3' ends of polyadenylated RNAs, in budding yeast. Analysis of transcript ends in coding regions uncovered hundreds of alternative-length coding forms, which harbored a unique sequence motif and showed signatures of regulatory function in particular gene categories; independent single-gene measurements confirmed the differential regulation of short coding forms during heat shock. In addition, our 3'-end RNA-seq method applied to wild-type strains detected putative noncoding transcripts previously reported only in RNA surveillance mutants, and many such transcripts showed differential expression in yeast cultures grown under chemical stress. Our results underscore the power of the 3'-end protocol to improve detection of noncanonical transcript forms in a sequencing experiment of standard depth, and our findings strongly suggest that many unannotated, polyadenylated RNAs may have as yet uncharacterized regulatory functions.},

@article{Zhang2005,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alternative polyadenylation is one of the mechanisms in human cells that give rise to a variety of transcripts from a single gene. More than half of the human genes have multiple polyadenylation sites (poly(A) sites), leading to variable mRNA and protein products. Previous studies of individual genes have indicated that alternative polyadenylation could occur in a tissue-specific manner. RESULTS: We set out to systematically investigate the occurrence and mechanism of alternative polyadenylation in different human tissues using bioinformatic approaches. Using expressed sequence tag (EST) data, we investigated 42 distinct tissue types. We found that several tissues tend to use poly(A) sites that are biased toward certain locations of a gene, such as sites located in introns or internal exons, and various sites in the exon located closest to the 3' end. We also identified several tissues, including eye, retina and placenta, that tend to use poly(A) sites not frequently used in other tissues. By exploring microarray expression data, we analyzed over 20 genes whose protein products are involved in the process or regulation of mRNA polyadenylation. Several brain tissues showed high concordance of gene expression of these genes with each other, but low concordance with other tissue types. By comparing genomic regions surrounding poly(A) sites preferentially used in brain tissues with those in other tissues, we identified several cis-regulatory elements that were significantly associated with brain-specific poly(A) sites. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that there are systematic differences in poly(A) site usage among human tissues, and both trans-acting factors and cis-regulatory elements may be involved in regulating alternative polyadenylation in different tissues.},
